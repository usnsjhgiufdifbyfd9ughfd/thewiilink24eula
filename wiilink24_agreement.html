Code of Conduct</b></p>
<p class="cjk" align="CENTER">
Last
Updated: 10.08.2015</p>
<p class="cjk">
<br>
</p>
<p class="cjk">
This
Wiimmfi Code of Conduct (“Wii Code of Conduct”)
outlines the rules that you must follow to participate in the Wii
Network Services. These rules are designed to keep Wiimmfi a friendly and safe environment.
</p>
<p class="cjk">
<br>
</p>
<p class="cjk">
<br>
</p>
<p class="cjk">
1.	Your
use of Wiimmfi is subject to this Wii Code of
Conduct, which prohibits all harmful, illegal or otherwise offensive
conduct, including, but not limited to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="cjk">
Misrepresenting,
impersonating, abusing, stalking, threatening or harassing any
person or company, including, but not limited to other users,
Wiimmfi itself, and/or its moderators.
</p>
</li><li><p class="cjk">
Doing
anything illegal, discriminatory, defamatory, hateful, harassing,
abusive, obscene, threatening, physically dangerous or otherwise
objectionable in connection with Wiimmfi.</p>
</li></ul>
<p class="cjk">
2.	Wiimmfi &amp; RiiConnect24
are not responsible for anything you say or anything that happens on
Wiimmfi or RiiConnect24 as a result of your use of said services
; you alone are responsible.</p>
<p class="cjk">
3.	Virtual
Property. Some games or other content may have certain features that
can be traded with other Wii Network Services users. For example, a
game might give you the ability to create a character that gathers
objects (like a car or gold coins) and has certain characteristics
(like a special ability or appearance). These features are sometimes
called “virtual property.” Nintendo (or its licensors)
own this virtual property, and you may not sell, trade, assign,
license, or otherwise convey virtual property for real money or for
Wii Points.
</p>
<p class="cjk">
4. Rules of Wiimmfi.
Wiimmfi has rules which are designed to make it a family friendly and cheater-free environment. Here are the rules:
<br></p><li>Do not use console ID changers of any kind
<br></li><li>Do not cheats that benefit you (VR hacks, item cheats, 
speed modifiers, texture hacks) when in Worldwide. They are, however 
allowed in region 191 and friend rooms, <b>if the host allows them.</b>
<p></p>
<p class="cjk">
<b>5. Wiimmfi &amp; RiiConnect24
reserves the right to immediately terminate or suspend your use of 
Wiimmfi or RiiConnect24 for, in their sole discretion, any violation of 
this Wii Code of Conduct or Wiimmfi rules.
All bans can be temporary, or permanent.</b>
